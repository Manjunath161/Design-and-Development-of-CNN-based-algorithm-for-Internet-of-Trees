# Design-and-Development-of-CNN-based-algorithm-for-Internet-of-Trees

#INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT

Machine learning algorithm which uses CNN for audio classification for internet of trees.AI technologies are applied to issues in ecological research and conservation.Passive monitoring methods such as audio   sensors, camera traps, etc help researchers to survey for wildlife.
Accurately locating signals of interest within large audio datasets is a persistent issue.The time and effort required to extract and classify detections of targets is reduced by automated and non-automated approaches.As tree cutting generates lot of noise ,it can be detected by regular monitoring of acoustic signals inside the forest.
The algorithms developed for image classification can be used to identify distinctive sounds which appear as visual patterns in resulting images.Collects and processes the audio datasets for detection of deforestation.

#MOTIVATION

	The motive of this project is to develop an anti-smuggling system that would be useful in the protected forest areas
	Sneaking of the trees such as sandal,red sander, teak, etc is a major national concern.
	To avoid smuggling and to spare the woodlands around the world ,we have come up with an idea that designs a system which is prepared to prevent the forest from fire accidents.

#BENEFITS

	If anybody tries to cut the tree the location will be tracked and information will be sent to control room .
	The trees are connected to sensors Individual attention is given on all the trees. 
	It is easier to install And operate with good results as sensors work accurately.
	 Database of all the trees can be maintained.
	Forest fires can be detected.
